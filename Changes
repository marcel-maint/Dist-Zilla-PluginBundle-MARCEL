    - Test::PodSpelling: add stopwords 'CPAN', 'multi'
    - Replace [NoTabsTests] with [Test::NoTabs]

1.121330  2012-05-12 00:06:22 Europe/Paris
    - minor internal build change: fixed stopwords locally in POD for a clean
      build.

1.120860  2012-03-26 01:20:17 Europe/Paris
    - this module has been abandoned by his original author (MARCEL). This is
      just a maintenance release to make the module work correctly from the
      CPAN to be able to maintain others modules made by MARCEL.
    - fixed plugin names for many *Tests to Test::* as they have moved on CPAN
      (Olivier Mengué)
    - Known bug: MANIFEST.SKIP generated by Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles
      is currently ignored by the ManifestSkip plugin in at least
      DZ 4.300010 and below, so MANIFEST.SKIP doesn't work. See RT#76036.
    - Known bug: some release testing plugins are buggy (for example
      Test::EOL 0.04) as they do not enforce that the module they use for
      testing is installed, and they skip the test instead of failing. This
      plugin bundle does not yet workaround that (by enforcing the dependency).
