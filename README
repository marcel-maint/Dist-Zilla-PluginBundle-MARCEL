NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::MARCEL - Build and release a distribution
    like MARCEL

VERSION
    version 1.113620

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

        [@MARCEL]
        major_version = 1          ; this is the default
        weaver        = pod        ; default, can also be 'task'
        skip_prereq   = ::Test$    ; no default

DESCRIPTION
    This is a plugin bundle to load all plugins that I am using. It is
    equivalent to:

        [AutoVersion]

        ; -- fetch & generate files

        [EOLTests]
        [InlineFilesMARCEL]
        [ReportVersions]

        ; -- remove some files
        [PruneCruft]
        [PruneFiles]
        filenames = dist.ini

        [ManifestSkip]

        ; -- get prereqs
        [AutoPrereq]

        ; -- gather metadata
        [Repository]
        [Bugtracker]
        [Homepage]

        ; -- munge files
        [ExtraTests]
        [NextRelease]
        [PkgVersion]
        [CopyReadmeFromBuild]
        [PodWeaver]
        config_plugin = '@MARCEL'

        ; -- dynamic meta-information
        [ExecDir]
        [ShareDir]
        [MetaProvides::Package]

        ; -- generate meta files
        [License]
        [MakeMaker]
        [MetaYAML]
        [MetaJSON]
        [ReadmeFromPod]
        [InstallGuide]
        [Manifest] ; should come last

        ; -- release
        [CheckChangeLog]
        [@Git]
        [UploadToCPAN]

    The following options are accepted:

    *   "major_version" - passed as "major" option to the AutoVersion
        plugin. Default to 1.

    *   "weaver" - can be either "pod" (default) or "task", to load
        respectively either PodWeaver or TaskWeaver.

    *   "weaver_finder" - a multi-value argument that overrides the default
        file finders used by PodWeaver.

    *   "skip_prereq" - passed as "skip" option to the AutoPrereq plugin if
        set. No default.

    *   "fake_home" - passed to Test::Compile to control whether to fake
        home.

METHODS
  mvp_multivalue_args
